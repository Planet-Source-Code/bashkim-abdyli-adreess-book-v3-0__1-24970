Hi, 
     This is new version of a family address book that 
I released some time ago. This time around I mostly use ADO
instead of DAO and now the user is allowed to add or remove
any category of their choice. It has a lot of features such 
as Personal Contacts, Personal Internet Links,
Search and Printing, Personal Reminders and also 
Sending Email using the vbSendmail component found on this site.
 
Default Login Information

Make sure that following files are placed in the same directory. 

1 - Family-v3.exe - This is the actual program itself, 
    do not run it until the database has been created.

2 - Famv3_create_dbase.exe - This is used to create 
    or recreate the database. 

3 - Famv3_fix.exe - This is used an Administrator to 
    loggout a user in case he/she was not logged out properly. 

4 - register.bat - This is used to register the file vbSendmail.dll     (this file has to  be registered properly for the program to 
    work - the full code can be found at http://www.freevbcode.com) 

5 - vbSendmail.dll - This is the component used to send email.
